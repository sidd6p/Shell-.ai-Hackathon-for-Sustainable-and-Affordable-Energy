# Shell AI Waste to Energy Challenge Solution

I am thrilled to share my successful journey in the Shell AI Waste to Energy Challenge, where I qualified for round 2 with my innovative solution. ðŸš€ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³

## Problem Statement

In the Shell AI Waste to Energy Challenge, participants were tasked with predicting future biomass production based on given datasets of harvesting sites and distance matrices. The challenge also involved selecting depots and refineries, as well as determining the optimal path from harvesting sites to processing depots and biomass refineries. The complexity of this problem required a deep understanding of data analysis, optimization, and forecasting techniques.

## Solution

After 35+ days of dedicated work and iterating through 50+ versions of my solution, I achieved the remarkable rank of 19 out of 1600+ submissions. I participated in the general edition, competing against submissions from universities, startups, and other general entries. Despite an initial glitch that displayed my rank as 41, it was later rectified, confirming my qualification within the top 20, the requirement for the next round.

My approach involved a meticulous analysis of the provided datasets, employing advanced data processing and machine learning techniques. I optimized the selection of depots and refineries, ensuring an efficient supply chain management system. Additionally, I determined the optimal paths for biomass transportation, enhancing overall productivity and minimizing costs.
